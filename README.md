# Deutsch Algorithm

This project implements the **Deutsch Algorithm**, one of the earliest examples of quantum speedup. It solves the problem of determining whether a binary function is **constant** or **balanced**, using just **one query** to a quantum oracle. This advantage is owed to quantum superposition and interference.

* Based on the final project for the bachelor in physics at Iran University of Science and Technology (2023)
